I attached a screw to the relic lift to help trigger the limit switches. It is adjustable so we can properly align it., Hardware
Shaashwat and I finished our autonomous logic up some more and tested it with the new hardware. Unfortunately all it did was spin in place so we'll have to check channel mappings tomorrow., Software
Today I made sure that all of our wires are safely stowed away so they wouldn't interfere with any of our mechanisms., Hardware
Today we covered some more debugging for the software side to begin to test the mechanical jewel knocker. It's pretty inconvenient that we had to test all of this before states but hey whatcha gonna do? Tomorrow should be filled with ample driver practice and a whole lot of testing., Software
Building off of the chassis that was made over the summer T-10 began to prepare it for presentation to the freshman. Since the team didn’t have a lot of functional code up until this point the robot was used merely as a display for the new members. The game was still very new to most of the members including the leaders so designing hardware apparatuses/prototypes will be for the brainstorming phases which will begin next meeting., Hardware
Codebase development was rather slow today because two of the software team members couldn’t show up due to aliaments. The work that was done was mainly getting the other software team members acquainted with the Kotlin programming language and whiteboarding how the team wanted to organize the team code., Software
I wrote a calculator program for calculating how far off center the middle hole needs to be drilled given the turn radius of the lift the degrees of turn per segment at full extension and the hole-to-hole length of each segment. It relies on the fact that an arc scissor lift is a string of trapezoids with the metal bars being the diagonals of a trapezoid. The calculator program also generates various important measures other than the center hole offset. These can be called using the letter names shown on the first sheet of paper., Hardware
The structure of the codebase was finalized. It was confirmed that the codebase is to have a subscribe/publish design. By having classes that acquire sensor information all the time we can then subscribe and publish data to these sensors to use in opmodes. This is a much easier system in the long run for fast prototyping of opmodes although setting the system up is a tedious process of planning and execution. The messages will be broadcasted using a Dispatcher class that is called to listen to channels where sensor data is being published., Software
Worked on the codebase and the dispatcher class which will handle pubsub methods. Finished the omnidirectional drive code so that it can move in all directions. Added rotation feature to omnidirectional drive now need to add speed scaler., Software
Added heartbeat (tick) which will be called in loop. The heartbeat will work similarly to an actual heart and send data (like blood) throughout the codebase so that our pubsub methods can easily obtain the information that way., Software
I got David Yin to start mounting expansion hubs and planning electronics schematic. I helped Shaashwat continue writing nodes for the software architecture. I continued helping the new members with software and some motor setup., Hardware
Had Davis write a brief summary of the outreach event since I was unable to attend. The event was a success since many parents asked questions of our club members who went and they got a better understanding of how FIRST robotics works., Outreach
Many of the Liquid Oxygen members appeared to be more involved today and I saw a lot of cooperation between the LO members to plan a basic drivetrain. I helped them further elaborate on the driving mechanisms in their code and I also taught them about the config file on the phone itself and how to hardware map. Besides that they seemed more self sufficient than they had been which is a step in the right direction., Outreach
Decided to think about Nov 18 FLL outreach event(Dec 16 will likely be difficult because happens the day before competition). Still need to figure out how many from LO2 are interested. Prefered to get tentative number to sign up ASAP., Outreach
Shaashwat and Davis confirmed that they could go to the FLL Outreach event and I worked with Misha to confirm our spot in the NHS Pep Rally video. All of the clubs in the school are supposed to lip-sync to a song and then they put the whole video together to make an opening video for pep rally. I also organized the Google Drive outreach folder and made a table so that it’s easier for the other members to see which events we have planned., Outreach
